His hand to mouth world has pinned all hopes on him. The motive of this world is not high aims, it’s to make a living and survive. It’s Kemal’s last year in mine engineering. His dreams are restricted with the truth and he doesn’t believe in miracles. Especially in miracles like love.  Kemal is soon tested with his disbelief and Nihan hops into his monotonous life. After that day Kemal’s world turns upside down and he loses control.  Nihan is the girl from the glamorous part of the town. She’s distant to the values of her environment; she’s actually distant to her own world. Kemal and Nihan’s love is as distant as a poor guy and a rich girl. But their love ignores the distance between them and they somehow manage to stay together until the day that Kemal has to leave Istanbul to work in a mine. That day will be a crossroad for Kemal and Nihan, a moment of a tough decision.",
